# Questions 10/01

  - fMRI data set is downloaded, but we do not know how to continue. Corresponding files from the ABIDE Github need C-PAC which is only available in Python 2.
  - Instruction on how to estimate Pearson matrix as described for the fMRI, generally what to do for the (pre-)processing for the fMRI data.
  - template report
  - elaboration on variable new_vars in aen_CEM.py
  - perform experiment on different dataset, such as Fashion-MNIST
  - difference between variables with and without self.adv_img vs self.adv_img_s
  - what model is being trained, if any? what does the attack function supposed to mean exactly?
  - mnist.h5 for MNISTModel pretrained required?
  - are we expected to train both models (autoencoder-decoder and MNISTModel) from the start up? if so: optimizer specifications for the MNISTModel are not mentioned in the paper
